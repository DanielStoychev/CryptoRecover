üöÄ **The most advanced cryptocurrency wallet recovery tool with groundbreaking Ethereum Layer 2 support**

*CryptoRecover 2.0.0-Stoychev* is an enhanced open source wallet password and seed recovery tool with revolutionary multi-chain capabilities.

For seed based recovery, this is primarily useful in situations where you have lost/forgotten parts of your mnemonic, or have made an error transcribing it. (So you are either seeing an empty wallet or getting an error that your seed is invalid)

For wallet password or passphrase recovery, it is primarily useful if you have a reasonable idea about what your password might be.

## Setup and Usage Tutorials ##
CryptoRecover 2.0.0-Stoychev is a Python (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12) script so will run on Windows, Linux and Mac environments. [See the installation guide for more info](https://github.com/DanielStoychev/CryptoRecover/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md)

This repository includes comprehensive documentation with example commands and file templates in the [./docs/](https://github.com/DanielStoychev/CryptoRecover/tree/master/docs) folder.

We recommend that you find a scenario that is most like your situation and follow the examples to ensure that you have the tool set up and running correctly. The documentation covers various recovery scenarios with detailed explanations.

If you don't know an address in the wallet that you are searching for, you can create and use an [Address Database (click here for guide)](https://github.com/DanielStoychev/CryptoRecover/blob/master/docs/Creating_and_Using_AddressDB.md) _There is no real performance penalty for doing this, it just takes a bit more work to set up_.

## Quick Start ##

To try recovering your password or a BIP39 passphrase, please start with the **[Password Recovery Quick Start](https://github.com/DanielStoychev/CryptoRecover/blob/master/docs/TUTORIAL.md#btcrecover-tutorial)**.

If you mostly know your recovery seed/mnemonic (12-24 recovery words), but think there may be a mistake in it, please see the **[Seed Recovery Quick Start](https://github.com/DanielStoychev/CryptoRecover/blob/master/docs/Seedrecover_Quick_Start_Guide.md)**.
