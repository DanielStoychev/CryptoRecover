# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

## üîí **Security Guidelines**

### **Security-First Development**
- Never hardcode private keys, seeds, or passwords
- Always validate user inputs
- Use secure random number generation
- Implement proper error handling without information leakage
- Write security tests for new functionality

### **Code Security Review**
All contributions undergo security review:
- Cryptographic operations must be tested
- Memory handling for sensitive data must be secure
- No network operations during recovery
- Input validation must be comprehensive

## üß™ **Testing Requirements**

### **Required Tests**
- **Unit tests** for all new functionality
- **Integration tests** for wallet recovery
- **Security tests** for cryptographic operations
- **Performance tests** for optimization claims

### **Test Categories**
```bash
# Core functionality tests
python -m pytest tests/test_core.py -v

# Cryptocurrency-specific tests
python -m pytest tests/test_ethereum_l2.py -v

# Security validation tests
python -m pytest tests/ -m security -v

# Performance benchmarks
python -m pytest tests/ -m performance -v
```

### **Test Coverage**
- New features must include comprehensive tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Performance improvements must include benchmarks
- Security features must include security tests

## üìö **Documentation Standards**

### **Code Documentation**
- All public functions must have docstrings
- Complex algorithms must have inline comments
- Type hints are required for new code
- Examples should be included for public APIs

### **User Documentation**
- User-facing features need usage examples
- Installation instructions for new dependencies
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Performance considerations and limitations

## üåê **Adding New Cryptocurrency Support**

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Research the cryptocurrency**
   - Derivation path standards
   - Address format specifications
   - Key derivation methods
   - Existing library support

2. **Create wallet class**
   ```python
   @register_selectable_wallet_class('NewCoin BIP39/44')
   class WalletNewCoin(WalletBIP39):
       def __init__(self, path=None, loading=False):
           if not path: 
               path = load_pathlist("./derivationpath-lists/NEWCOIN.txt")
           super(WalletNewCoin, self).__init__(path, loading)
   ```

3. **Implement required methods**
   - `_addresses_to_hash160s()` - Address validation
   - `pubkey_to_hash160()` - Address generation
   - Any cryptocurrency-specific logic

4. **Add derivation paths**
   - Create `derivationpath-lists/NEWCOIN.txt`
   - Include standard and common derivation paths

5. **Write comprehensive tests**
   ```python
   class TestNewCoinWallet:
       def test_address_generation(self):
           # Test address generation from known seeds
           
       def test_address_validation(self):
           # Test address format validation
           
       def test_derivation_paths(self):
           # Test all supported derivation paths
   ```

6. **Update documentation**
   - Add to supported cryptocurrencies list
   - Create usage examples
   - Update installation requirements if needed

### **Cryptocurrency Support Checklist**
- [ ] Wallet class implemented and registered
- [ ] Address generation/validation working
- [ ] Derivation paths configured
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Example usage provided

## üé® **Code Style Guidelines**

### **Python Code Style**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use Black for code formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use type hints for new code

### **Git Commit Messages**
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(eth): add Arbitrum L2 wallet support
fix(core): handle Unicode characters in passwords
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(security): add cryptographic validation tests
