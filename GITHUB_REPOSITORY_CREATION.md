# GitHub Repository Creation Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in with your account
2. **Click the green "New" button** (usually in upper left corner or at github.com/new)
3. **Configure the repository:**
   - **Repository name:** `CryptoRecover`
   - **Description:** `CryptoRecover 2.0.0-Stoychev: Advanced Bitcoin & multi-cryptocurrency recovery tool with industry-first Ethereum Layer 2 support. Supports BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE, BCH, DASH, ZEC, and more with comprehensive wallet recovery capabilities.`
   - **Visibility:** ✅ **Public** (important for sharing your work)
   - **Initialize repository:** 
     - ❌ **DO NOT** add README (we already have one)
     - ❌ **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)
     - ❌ **DO NOT** choose a license (we already have GPL v2.0)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the commands. Use these EXACT commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/DanielStoychev/CryptoRecover.git

# Verify the remote was added correctly
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub (this uploads all your code)
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. **Refresh your GitHub repository page**
2. **Verify all files are uploaded:**
   - README.md shows your enhanced description
   - All 902 files are present
   - Your commit message appears
